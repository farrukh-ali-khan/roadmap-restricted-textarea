# Restricted Textarea with Live Character Count

## Project Description

This project creates a **textarea** that tracks and displays the number of characters typed by the user, along with a maximum character limit. As the user types, the character count updates dynamically. Once the character limit is reached, the textarea will prevent further input and the border will turn red to visually indicate the limit has been hit.

## Features

- **Live Character Count**: The number of characters typed is displayed in real-time.
- **Character Limit**: Prevents further input when the maximum character count is reached (150 characters by default).
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - The textarea's border turns red when the character limit is reached.
  - The text turns red to highlight the limit.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styles the textarea and provides visual feedback.
- **JavaScript**: Used for dynamic character count updates and enforcing the character limit.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Handles real-time updates to the textarea's border and character count.

## Customization

- You can change the maximum character limit by adjusting the `maxlength` attribute in the HTML code.
- Modify the styles in `styles.css` to fit your desired color scheme or design.
